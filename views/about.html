            <h1>Biography</h1>

            <p>
                Hello, my name is <b>Chris</b>. <br/>
                I build beautiful things.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I have always enjoyed writing code,</strong><br/>
                and have been fortunate enough to experience the advent of powerful computers to come to a rise in demand for
                more capable software to quell the worlds insatiable demand for the booming tech market.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>I've had my hand in quite a few ventures.</strong><br/>
                I've learned that there is more to software than algorithms and endless coverage in test cases.<br/>
                I've learned that there is more to a startup than clean code, funding, and a good idea.<br/>
                I've learned that there is more to investing than the hype and promise of a portfolio.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>

                My professional background includes working in companies that focused in Product Development and Creative Website Development.
                I have several years of experience with working with the entire stack, end to end. Especially with Front-End User Interface Design and within those years came a meticulous attention to detail.
                I absolutely pride myself in my work and work ethic. I am ambitious and I always take personal interest in spending my own personal time to improve my capabilities to update myself with the most recent cutting-edge technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my background in working with advertising agencies, I take a very pragmatic approach to the layout design.
                I feel numbers always come first. The numbers don't lie.
                I base everything on website metrics and performance I will provide a variety of solutions that yield an improvement for conversions.
                In the end after all of the practicalities I will find a way to make the end result beautiful yet functional.
                The key to my work ethic is to keep things simple, and to never over complicate any part of my design process.
